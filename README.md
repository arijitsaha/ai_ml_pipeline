# AI/ML Pipelines with Python
Workshop on building AI/ML Pipeline using Python

Summary:
In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn how to use Python for building AI/ML
Pipelines.
Participants will work on a real-life scenario of building AI/ML pipeline covering the various
aspects like
• Ingesting data
• Cleaning & Transforming data
• Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset
• Running ML models
• Analyzing results
• Conclusion: Stitching it all-together as a Pipeline
As part of this workshop participants will be introduced to various useful Python libraries
that every AI/ML Engineer should know. The session will cover various other aspects of a
robust, scalable AI/ML pipeline.


Prerequisites:
This is an intermediate level hands-on workshop on Python.
To benefit from this course the participants are expected to have
• Basic familiarity with Python programming
• Conceptual knowledge of data pipelines, relational data and big data
• Using Jupyter Python notebook environment
